# Ceaser Messenger Purpose

* The purpose of this stage is to show what a protocol looks like with the most basic encryption possible, a ceaser cipher. As I add more stages, I'll add more, stronger encryption methods.

# Ceaser Messenger Cracking

* The one strength of this protocol is that the key itself is not sent over the network (I think I'll introduce key exchange in the next stage). This means that if you are sitting in the middle of a connection between two people, you won't easily know what the key is. However, Ceaser Ciphers are very easy to crack, so if you have the messages, you can easily crack the key and decrypt the messages.
